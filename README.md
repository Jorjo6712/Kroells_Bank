# Kroells_Bank

This project was made in relation to our database course as part of our education.
We made a MSSQL database which represents a bank. We also made a C# WPF app which is an ATM. 
You can log in on the ATM, using a pin code associated to a client of the bank.
We had a week to complete this project.
